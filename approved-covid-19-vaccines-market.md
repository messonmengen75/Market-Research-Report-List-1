<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Approved COVID-19 Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Component Viral Vaccines</li><li>Whole Virus Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The approved COVID-19 vaccines are classified into two main market types: component viral vaccines and whole virus vaccines. Component viral vaccines utilize specific parts of the virus, such as proteins, to stimulate an immune response without using live virus, exemplified by mRNA and protein subunit vaccines. In contrast, whole virus vaccines employ inactivated or attenuated versions of the virus, prompting immunity through exposure to the entire pathogen. Both types aim to safely prime the immune system against COVID-19.</p></p>
