<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cesium Iodide Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cesium Iodide detectors are categorized into two main types based on their conversion processes: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors utilize a scintillator layer to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then detected by a photodetector. In contrast, direct conversion detectors rely on cesium iodide to convert X-ray photons directly into electrical charges. Both types are utilized in medical imaging, with direct conversion often offering improved image quality and efficiency, while indirect conversion may be more cost-effective.</p></p>
