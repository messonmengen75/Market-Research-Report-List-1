<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Borehole Enlargement System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed-diameter Reamers</li><li>Hydraulically Expandable Reamers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Borehole Enlargement System market features two primary types: fixed-diameter reamers and hydraulically expandable reamers. Fixed-diameter reamers provide consistent borehole enlargements at specific diameters, ensuring precise and uniform results, often used in standard drilling applications. In contrast, hydraulically expandable reamers can adjust their diameter during drilling, allowing for greater versatility and efficiency in varying geological conditions. This flexibility enhances operational efficiency and reduces costs by enabling a single tool to perform multiple tasks within the borehole.</p></p>
